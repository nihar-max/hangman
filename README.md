# hangman
Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. In this given project we created a list in which consists of all the popular Hollywood actors and our task is to guess that actor name letter by letter, where we have only 6 chances. So our task is to create this game with help of simple python programming with help of Loops, List etc. etc.
